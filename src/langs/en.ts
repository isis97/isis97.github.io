**Quick intro**
`,
  'about_me_text': `
I am currently on my 3rd year pursuing Bachelor deegree on University of Warsaw (Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics).
  
I love programming. It's my passion. I am interested in various topics:
 * I love IoT ([AVR stuff](https://github.com/styczynski/avr-weather-esp8266)) and programming FPGAs
 * I love real-time hardcore distributed systems!
 * I love making frontend :))
 * I like Machine Learning, but it's highly amateur stuff for now. I also organised this [PL in ML Conference](http://plinml.mimuw.edu.pl) with friends of mine ;)
 * I really like functional languages and written frontend in Mathamatica for n-dimensional tic-tac-toe game (hey, you did what?) [see here](https://github.com/styczynski/mathematica-playground)

I love assembly, low level-hacking things and I can be categorised as a geek who can't wait to know how that *new cutting-edge technology works*. 

**Now you can scroll down. Hover and click things to see why I did *that strange project* or read some details about me :))**
**Good luck explorer!**

  'open_source_description': `
**Limitless universe**

I love to make software. I love the Open Source.
Below few of my open projects are included.

They are mostly done in part-time so maintenece is not as good as I think it should be.

  'experiments_description': `
**Exploring new worlds**

As I am still a student I've got time for playing and making experiments with various toolings and software.
  
Some of these projects were written for university assignments, some of them are really obscure, old code and
some are really cool stuff.

  'space_junk_description': `
**You entered a space junk area - outer hull may damage in contact with fast micro obejcts.**

This is area of obscure, old code that's not maintained in any way.
This was written years ago and published more recently.
The code hangs there for me only as a documentation of my interests before highscool (proof of beeing hackish child from the begining of time?)
